# Contributing to Gettext-Helpers


First off, thanks for your interest in helping out!

**Important Note:** First and foremost, the purpose of the code in this repository is to build the translations for [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), the Scientific Python Development Environment.
Therefore, all additions, changes and removals should not conflict with or otherwise hinder its ability to do so. Thanks!

For more guidance on the basics of using ``git`` and Github to contribute to Spyder and its documentation, please see the contributing guidelines in the main Spyder repository mentioned above, and check out the [Spyder Development Documentation](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Contributing-to-Spyder) for detailed instructions.
